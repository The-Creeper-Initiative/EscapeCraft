# EscapeCraft
Like Minecraft but an escape-room....

## Setup

Since the app will not be built for quite a while, you will have to run it manually. Thankfully, the `ursina` library makes this incredibly easy.

First, run 
`pip3 install ursina` (or `pip install ursina`).

Once ursina is installed, just run `python3 main.py`
